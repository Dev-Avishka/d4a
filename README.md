# D4A
D4A is an audio file format that I created using java , This file format is lighter than mp4 with having the same audio quality.

# How much is reduced from the file
| Mp3 size | D4a Size |
| :--- | ---: | 
| 50mb | 25mb |
| 40mb | 15mb |
| 13 mb | 6mb |

This File Size is achived through changing how the file is encoded as this files along side the standard with the binary on how the analog has been changed in a specific way to drop this low.
